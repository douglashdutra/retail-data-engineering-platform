Modern Retail Data Engineering Platform

Spark + Delta Lake + Databricks

---

Overview:
This repository documents the development of a data engineering platform built progressively over an initial 6 month scope.

The project initially simulates a retail company environment, with the intention of evolving from a exploratory analysis to a production-style spark-based lakehouse structure architecture with CI/CD and infrastructure components.

The idea is to demonstrate practical data engineering skills aligned with modern industry standards with the Databricks ecosystem, evolving as I deepen my knowledge.
